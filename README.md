- 👋 Hi, I’m @MentalManManic
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, filmmaking, having a good time and being overtly critical of things I don't like, and blindly passionate about things I do like, that's a lil sarcastic
- 🌱 I’m currently learning film prodution, nearing the end of my bachelor degree, and chose video game design as an elective.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game design mainly.
- 📫 How to reach me, hold your arm out and stretch as far as you can. Then email me ig.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/They
- ⚡ Fun fact: Last time I streamed was when Spider-Man 2 came out, and I really want to do it again. DBD is really fun.
